    "What is a Bidirectional RNN?\n",
    "A Bidirectional RNN is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that learns information from both the past and the future of a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of processing the input sequence in just one direction (like standard RNNs), a bidirectional RNN consists of two RNNs:\n",
    "\n",
    "One processes the sequence forward (left to right)\n",
    "\n",
    "One processes the sequence backward (right to left)\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs of both directions are typically concatenated or summed to produce a final representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "üöÄ When Should You Use a Bidirectional RNN?\n",
    "You should use a Bidirectional RNN when the context from both past and future is useful to understand the current word or token in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Typical Use Cases:\n",
    "Use Case\tWhy Bidirectional Helps\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition (NER)\tTo identify a person's name, you might need both what comes before and after the word\n",
    "Part-of-Speech Tagging\tA word's role depends on its surrounding context (e.g., \"bear\" in \"bear fruit\" vs. \"bear attack\")\n",
    "Speech Recognition\tThe pronunciation of a phoneme might depend on surrounding phonemes\n",
    "Text Classification (in some cases)\tUnderstanding the full meaning of a sentence sometimes requires both directions\n",
    "Machine Translation (Encoder side)\tEncoding a sentence in both directions gives a fuller representation before translation\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùå When Not to Use It?\n",
    "Real-time applications (e.g., live speech recognition or time series forecasting)\n",
    "Because bidirectional models require access to future context, they aren‚Äôt suitable for online or real-time systems where future inputs are not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîÅ Summary:\n",
    "Feature\tBidirectional RNN\tStandard RNN\n",
    "Context\tPast + Future\tPast only\n",
    "Accuracy\tOften higher\tLower for certain NLP tasks\n",
    "Latency\tHigher (can‚Äôt stream)\tLower (streaming possible)\n",
    "Use Case\tNER, POS tagging, sentiment analysis\tTime series forecasting, real-time prediction"
